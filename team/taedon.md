My name is Taedon Reth. I'm a third year student studying computer science at UCSB.
My initial interest for this project came about because I often struggle to have a holistic view of my 4 year plan at UCSB. Gold is hard to use and it doesn't have a 'plan ahead' feature. Thus, we want this project to provide an easy to use academic planning web app.
