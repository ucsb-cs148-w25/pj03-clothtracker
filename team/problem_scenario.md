# Problem Scenario

## Title
Four-year Schedule Planner for UCSB GOLD

## Description
Students have difficulty planning their courses for graduation long term on UCSB's current registration platform. Currently GOLD only allows planning one quarter in advance when the registration period opens.

## Context
- **User Role**: University students
- **Proposed User Role**: Academic Advisors
- **Goals**: Plan courses ahead of time to meet graduation requirements

## Proposed Solution
GauchoGraduate aims to integrate a four year view to visualize and track courses needed for graduation. Users can drag and drop selected courses into each corresponding quarter to plan their classes as far in advance as they need.
