####### Expanded Description
Easier to use alternative compared to gold, so that students can plan their 4 year graduation course load. Gold's current feature only allow for planning one quarter in advance once the registration opens. Our app aims to allow students to have easier course planning in future quarters and make it easier to follow with more straightforward features. Students can put in their major and create a personal 4 year plan making sure it follows the requirements. Should be easier and quicker to use compared to GOLD.

######## User Roles
- GauchoGraduate will have two types of users: Students, that are able to create their course plan. Faculty, that are able to edit and review the students course plan.

######### Roles and Permission
- Restricting the user base to @ucsb.edu. Allows us to reach only our target audience, which is UCSB students.
- Goals for Faculty : Review Course Proposals and long-term student schedules in one place. Provide better academic advice by visualizing progress toward degree completion.
- Goals for Student : Create 4 year plan scheduling. Have an easy and simple time when creating schedule.
